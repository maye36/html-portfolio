<p>Silenced (Korean: 도가니; English: "The Crucible") is a 2011 South Korean crime drama film based on the novel 
    The Crucible by Gong Ji-young. The film depicts the story
    of a school for the hearing-impared where young deaf
    students were sexually assaulted by the faculty members
    This movie encapsulates how society has failed to help the marginalized
    such as people with disability. Moreover, this questions 
    the effectivity of the systems placed by the government to support 
    the need. One of the most unnerving but intriging film that I have watched this year</p>
<h3>Promising Young Woman</h3>

<p>This was recommended by the youtubers "Cinema Therapy". 
   It is about a young woman who takes upon herself to seek
   revenge for her best friend who committed suicide after being
   raped by their classmate. 
   For what I remembered, I was very uncomfortable watching this movie.
   Cassie, the main character, was in a very vulnerable state. She would 
   go to clubs and be almost raped by any guy she met in the bar. This shows
   how women are always vulnerable unless society intervenes.

<p>This is a live action series based on the Japanese manga "Barakamon" ばらかもん.
    Seishuu Handa is a an rising calligrapher: young, handsome and talented.
    When a veteran lables his piece as unoriginal, he completely lose his composure
    with severe repercussion. As punishment, his father exiles him to the Goto Islands where 
    he meets boisterous children, fujoshi middle schoolers and energetic elderly. 
    Same as the anime, it is a very refreshing series.
